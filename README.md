# CQF Math Primer
CQF Math Primer (no answers)

Not going to lie, this test was difficult for me! I struggled to get through it and had to do a lot of research in the middle of each question.  
On average, I spent an hour or more on each one. 

Recreating the test here in markdown was a good way to get brushed back up on LaTeX.
That also added to the time spent on the questions.

Final score 22 of 26.

## Question 1
### Second Order Derivative

The second order derivative $\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} \text{ of } f(x) = x \exp(-x)$

Possible answers:
1. $e^{-x}(x^2 - 1)$
2. $e^{-x}(x - 1)$
3. $f(x) + 2e^{-x}$ 
4. $f(x) - 2e^{-x}$
5. $f(x) - e^{-x}$
