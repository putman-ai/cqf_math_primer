# CQF Math Primer
CQF Math Primer (no answers)

Not going to lie, this test was difficult for me! I struggled to get through it and had to do a lot of research in the middle of each question.  
On average, I spent an hour or more on each one. 

Recreating the test here in markdown was a good way to get brushed back up on LaTeX.
Although I'm sure some of that is wrong as well!
That also added to the time spent on the questions.

Final score 22 of 26.


## Question 1
### Second Order Derivative

The second order derivative $\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} \text{ of } f(x) = x \exp(-x)$

Possible answers:
1. $e^{-x}(x^2 - 1)$
2. $e^{-x}(x - 1)$
3. $f(x) + 2e^{-x}$ 
4. $f(x) - 2e^{-x}$
5. $f(x) - e^{-x}$


## Question 2
### Combining First and Second Deriviatives.
Given $y = \ln |1-x|$ find an expression for $\frac{dy}{dx} + x\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$

Possible answers:
1. $\frac{1}{(1-x)}$
2. $-\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$
3. $\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}$
4. $(1-x)$
5. $\frac{1}{(1-x^2)^2}$


## Question 3
### Limiting Problem: Cubic Derivative
What is the value of the limiting problem  
$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{{(x+h)^3 - x^3}}{{h}}$$

Possible answers:
1. $0$
2. $\infty$
3. $-\infty$
4. $3x^2$
5. None of these are correct
